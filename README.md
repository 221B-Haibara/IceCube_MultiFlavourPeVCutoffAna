# IceCube Multi-flavour PeV Cutoff Analysis
MC pseudo experiments in order to estimate sensitivity

Details:

#[One-D scans] (added for Mainz meeting)
fake nature: cutoff at 2.31, 2.7 PeV
H1: cutoff at 2.31, 2.7 PeV - maximum likelihood
H0: sliding cutoff energy
Aim: how well can we constrain cutoff energy

round1 : HESE cascades
round2 : PEPE
round3 : EHE track
round4 : HESE + EHE tracks
round5 : combined cascade

conclusion : which sample is important for cutoff?

#[Two-D scans] 

#[Three-D scans] (added before Madison meeting 2017)
H1: cutoff at 2.7 PeV (Lars best fit)
H0: scan for normalisation, gamma and cutoff
Note: signal(nue+nutau) vs background (CR)

round1: PEPE [cut on 0.45,10]
round2: HESE cascades
round3: EHE
round4: all

#confidence level scan
scan energy 20 bins, drop 10,000 trials for each, calculate the LLH distribution

#Asimov test
calculate using the predicted value of the bin
