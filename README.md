# IceCube Multi Flavour PeV Cutoff Analysis
Two methods: Asimov and MC pseudoexperiments in order to estimate uncertainty by calculating likelhihood of the "Pepe" (PeV Energy Partially contained Events) analysis.

Details:

[One-D scans]

H1: no cutoff
H0: sliding cutoff energy
Aim: how well can we reject no cutoff

H1: cutoff at 2.7 PeV
H0: sliding cutoff energy
Aim: how well can we fit the cutoff

round1 : combined cascade
round2 : EHE track
round3 : PEPE
round4 : HESE cascades
round5 : HESE + EHE tracks?

conclusion : which sample is important for cutoff?

[Two-D scans]
H1: no cutoff
H0: sliding cutoff energy
Aim: how well can we reject no cutoff
perhaps already include normalisation?
